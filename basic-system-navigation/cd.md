# `cd` – Directory to Directory Navigation

The `cd` command is used to change the **current working directory** in Linux and Unix systems. It allows users to **navigate** through the file system by **moving** between **directories** and specifying different **paths**.

**Options**

The `cd` command typically doesn't use **options** in the same way as other commands. Instead, it relies on **path arguments** and **special characters** for navigation.

### Examples

- **Go to /etc directory**
  ```bash
  cd /etc
  ```
  **Output:** Changes current directory to /etc

- **Go back one level**
  ```bash
  cd ..
  ```
  **Output:** Moves to parent directory

- **Go to home directory**
  ```bash
  cd ~
  ```
  **Output:** Changes to user's home directory

- **Go up double directory**
  ```bash
  cd ../..
  ```
  **Output:** Moves up two directory levels
